# Project Write-up

A foresighting analysis of a species for the Gulf of Maine. This can be built around the climate projection you've constructed through the coding exercises. It can also incorporate other forecasting approaches if you'd like to bring in something additional.

Content
 - Sections
   - Introduction: What is your species? Why is it important? What are some of the management, industry, or conservation decisions that could benefit from a forecast?
   - Data: What is the distribution in time and space of your data? What are the strengths, weaknesses, caveats?
   - Modeling: Go through your approach and results, including a projection to future climate conditions.
   - Implications: How does your prediction influence the decisions around this species that you discussed in the introduction? You can also discuss next steps or open questions.
 - Refer to the "Forecast Cards" questions we used to guide our discussions
   - Link to be added after discussion takes place
 - Word count: Approximately 2,000
 - References: Must include primary literature. Aim for at least five primary literature references. Can also use news reports, etc. to supplement.
   
Style
   - Consistent language. E.g. If you use first person, do so consistently. Use tense consistently.
   - Language does not have to be overly complex-- Most important to be clear
   - Appropriate use of references
   - Lines of argumentation are clear and concise
   - Clear how methods address main question(s) / goal(s)

Refer to the readings and lecture content to inform your write-up. One example of a paper that does a 2050 projection for the Gulf of Maine is Camille's paper on right whales. This goes much further than someone can do in a single month, but it's good context: https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/9/1/00058/116780/Projecting-regions-of-North-Atlantic-right-whale
